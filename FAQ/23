Download this spreadsheet and keep it handy to input current blockheight and amount of coins you are staking when you want to know.
You can also enter a percentage for guessing how many coins are actually staking, to see when it matches your own actual average.
See your own percentage of total coins possible to stake, and pay attention to the number day to day, to see how your position holds up.
The spreadsheet will also show how many days until the next halvings.
The calculation of timelocked coins being unlocked is based on an average for the entire period, but should be fairly accurate, and is included in the total of staking coins.
