[edit notes: Clarified/corrected that dates provided are approximate and not exact. Fixed the calculation that would give an irrational solve when blockstomature=current block as well as an incorrect solve when blockstomature<current block.]

Q: How do I know when an immature block will "unlock" (mature)?  You can use the following scripts to automate it (prints, for each block, how many blocks remaining and the estimated date). Keep in mind that the actual number of blocks per day is not always exactly 1440. It varies and the estimated dates may change slightly over time:
#!/bin/bash

#Config
verus_path="/XXXX/verus-cli/"
verus_cli="verus"

get_transactions=( $($verus_path$verus_cli listtransactions "" 1000 0|grep blockstomaturity|sed 's/.e: //;s/,//g'|awk '{ print $2 }'|sort -n) )
cur_block=( $($verus_path$verus_cli getmininginfo|grep blocks":|sed 's/.e: //;s/,//g'|awk '{ print $2 }') )
arr_idx="0"

for i in "${get_transactions[@]}"
do
        days_to_mature=$(( ($i )/1440 ))
        mature_to_date=$(date +"%m-%d-%Y" -d "+$days_to_mature days")
        echo ""Block #" $arr_idx "will mature in approximately"$days_to_mature "days" "(" $mature_to_date ")" "
        ((arr_idx++))
done
