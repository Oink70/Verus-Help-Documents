Q: How do I direct all my mined rewards to a single Verus wallet?
A:
Step 1 - First get your wallet address you want to mine to:
IN AGAMA GUI
Click "Receive", click "Get New Address" and choose "Transparent Address" from the drop down.
IN VERUS-CLI
You can find an address if you already have previous transactions, or you can create a new one.  To find an address from a previous transaction, use the command line verus listtransactions and copy the address found after "address".
To generate a new wallet address, use the command line verus getnewaddress and a new address will be created.

Step 2 - Next, using your new address, enter the command with verus-cli verus validateaddress. From the output find the long string after "pubkey", copy without the quotation marks.

Step 3 - Last, use this pubkey when starting your daemon by adding the following line to the end of your command, just before the "&" sign: -pubkey=THELONGSTRINGCOPIED

Your rewards will now be mined to that address.  It would be a good idea to keep notes and associate the wallet address with the pubkey...also to double check that you did validate the correct pubkey for the wallet address, making sure you made no errors.(edited)
