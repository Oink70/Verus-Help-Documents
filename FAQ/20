FAQ 20:
(submitted by @jimboscott):

Q. What should I do if I end up on my own fork because of a network issue or having an old version of the wallet?  For Windows GUI or CLI users.
1.)  Stop the wallet/mining process  by cleanly shutting down the program.
2.)  Make a backup of your wallet.dat file found in ...users/[your account]/AppData/roaming/Komodo/VRSC - Remember, this folder is a hidden folder and you must have your viewing preferences set to show hidden files and folders.
3.)  After making your backup of the wallet.dat file, delete everything other than the wallet.dat file from the ...users/[your account]/AppData/roaming/Komodo/VRSC folder.  Leave the wallet.dat file in place.  You backed this file up only as a precaution.
4.)  Download and extract the contents of either the 0.3.12a or later GUI or CLI wallet/miner.
5.)  Run the CLI or GUI version and let it resync with the proper chain.  If it hangs up on syncing, quit the wallet cleanly and start it up again.
6.)  Do not be dismayed if it seems that your mining rewards suddenly seem to come to a halt.  Remember, when you mine to the wrong chain rewards can come in very quickly, but they are worth nothing.
