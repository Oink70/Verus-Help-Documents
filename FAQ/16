How can I tell the difference between stacked and mined coins?

You can check this in the VerusExplorer https://explorer.veruscoin.io/
CLI:  In the CLI I installed and use a browser like links2.  To check my last 10 transactions in the verus-cli folder I enter ./verus listtransactions. I copy the blockhash of the received award I want to check and add it at the end of https://explorer.veruscoin.io/api/getblock? like this this: links2 https://explorer.veruscoin.io/api/getblock?hash=9e6fa91356211a554c580c90ec9c2067dd420ff74c7d33481775793f7b0e7f03 – so this one is minted....

In the GUI you can also click yourself thru to that information. Click on the magnifying glass all the way on the right of the transaction. On the pop-up click on "Open in the VRSC Explorer" bottom left. In the VRSC explorer click on the block hash value (in light blue) – now the block hash is displayed as the title of the box. Click on the info i on the right and search  in the result displayed for blocktype 'mined' or 'minted'.(edited)
