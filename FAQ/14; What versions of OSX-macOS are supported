Question: What versions of OSX/macOS are supported?

Answer:
Currently only macOS 10.12.x and up are tested and supported. Installing on OSX  10.11.x or earlier may be possible but the wallet does not function and never completes the initial sync.

If you installed on OSX 10.11.x or earlier and need to remove it:
1. Quit the Agama Wallet.
2. Eject the Agama dmg.
3. Make a backup of Wallet.day & VRSC.conf if necessary (Only if you had Agama working or if you used an existing Wallet.dat)
4. If you installed the Agama.app in Applications, move this to the trash.
5. Move ~/Library/Application Support/Agama to the trash or use the following command in terminal
rmdir /Users/<username>/Library/Application\ Support/Agama.
6. Move ~/Library/Application Support/Komodo to the trash or use the following command in terminal
rmdir /Users/<username>/Library/Application\ Support/Komodo.

7. Upgrade OS.
8. Install Agama (Check "HOW-TO Bootstrap your wallet.txt" for a smooth install)
