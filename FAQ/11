Q: I'm mining since XYZ with XYZ, why I haven't found a block yet?

time_to_find_one_block = ( NetworkHashrate / LocalHashrate ) * BlockTime

One block = 384 coins (as now)
NetworkHashrate = retrieved by getmininginfo command
LocalHashrate = same as above
BlockTime = 60 seconds (average)

Real example with - 24 threads Intel Skylake 2.0Ghz -

time_to_find_one_block = ( 12527490696 / 9983712 ) * 60
time_to_find_one_block = 75.287 seconds (20,91 hours)
